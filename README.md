AlienBot is really easy to use, all you have to do is type the commands/answers in a txt file and the bot will do the rest ;)

Everything you need to know before launching your bot:
- You will have to configure the bot before starting it, otherwise it won't respond to anything. (I guess it's obvious, if you don't tell it what to respond it won't respond at all)
- There are 5 txt files in the folder. Each one of them has it's own purpose. 
  - added_friends.txt = The bot will log the newly added friends there.
  - admin.txt = There you can tell the bot who is admin, by steamID3. Admins can use commands to control the bot like !shutdown or !friends.
  - chat.txt = There you can set what to respond and what the answer will be. Type them like in the example to make sure the bot will functionate well.
  - friend_welcome_message.txt = When someone add the bot, the bot will immediately accept it and send a welcome message. In this txt file you can configure this message. Leave it blank if you don't want to send welcome message on friend accept.
  - logs.txt = The bot will log everything there with the exact time and date when it happened. The bot will log who has been added, who sent message to the bot, the used commands etc.
